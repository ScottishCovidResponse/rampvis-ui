                {" "}
                A time-series is an ordered sequence which represents
                observations that changes over time [1]. It is represented as{" "}
                <MathJax.Node inline formula={timeseriesFormula} /> where{" "}
                <MathJax.Node inline formula={`\\mathrm{n}`} /> is the last
                element and length of the time-series object. For the
                covid-data, a time-series database is created. For one country,
                there are several indicators introducing multi-dimensional data
                (cases, deaths, icu admissions, tests).
              </p>
              <p>
                The tool&apos;s aim is to rank and display statistically closest
                temporal movements given a query time-series. This is solved by
                defining a similarity or distance measure between the
                time-series object to estimate how close the temporal movements
                are [2]. The distance and similarity score between two
                time-series objects x and y are defined as [2]:
                <MathJax.Node formula={distanceScore} />
                <MathJax.Node formula={similarityScore} /> where{" "}
                <MathJax.Node inline formula={`a`} /> is scalar.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given a query time-series,(ex: last month&apos;s biweekly cases
                per million for France) and similarity measure (Euclidean
                distance) the system sorts most similar time-series from past.
              </p>
              <h2>Similarity measures</h2>
              <p>
                Distance measures can be categorized in numerous ways. Some
                algorithms favors the similarity in the linear relationship of
                the curves [3], others favor the similarity in time by using
                one-to-one point alignment [4]. For longer time-series, there
                are model-based (ARIMA) [5] and feature based (DFT) [6]
                algorithms which fit the time-series into a parametric model or
                extract features using dimension reduction methods respectively.
                The distance measures available tool are divided into two
                categories (lock-step and elastic measures) by how the points
                from two time-series objects can align. Distance measures can be
                categorized in numerous ways. Some algorithms favors the
                similarity in the linear relationship of the curves [3], others
                favor the similarity in time by using one-to-one point alignment
                [4]. For longer time-series, there are model-based (ARIMA) [5]
                and feature based (DFT) [6] algorithms which fit the time-series
                into a parametric model or extract features using dimension

                by how the points from two time-series objects can align.
              </p>
              <h3>Lock-step measures</h3>
              <p>
                Lock step measures compare the points at the exact same temporal
                position [7]. The most used lock step measure to compare
                time-series is the Minkowski distance, also known as Lp norm
                [7]. For p = 1, the distance measure is called Manhattan or
                city-block distance. This uses the absolute value of the
                difference between time-points [8]. For p = 2, Euclidean
                distance is obtained [8]. This measure is the most common method
                used for one dimensional applications, but for higher
                dimensions, Manhattan distance is more preferable [10]. Both
                distance measures are sensitive to noises [8]. If there is a
                high amplitude noise in the signal, all of the score is
                dominated by this point as the distance measures sum up the
                difference values of corresponding points. This effect increases
                naturally as p is increased. For the limit p → ∞, Chebyshev
                distance is obtained which takes the maximum distance between
                all temporal pairs [8]. Geometrical representation and formulae
                are below:

              </div>
              <h3>Elastic measures</h3>
              <p>
                Elastic measures are more complex algorithms that are able to
                work with time-series with different length and sampling rate
                [7]. Unlike the lock-step measure approach, they allow elastic
                temporal alignments in the time-series. Dynamic time warping
                (DTW) and longest common sub-sequence (LCS) algorithms are
                available in the tool. The pseucode for the algorithms are shown
                below. Euclidean distance is chosen as the metric to be used in
                both elastic measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                DTW algorithm calculates the perfect alignment between the
                time-series objects. It takes two time-series objects and
                transforms their time alignment into a warped time shape by
                using repeated/removed temporal points [9]. It allows for
                one-to-many and many-to-one matching between temporal points
                [9]. This is done by generating a distance matrix from time
                series and finding the distance path corresponding to minimal
                cost from the origin to the end-point [9]. For two time-series x
                and y with lengths n and m respectively, the algorithm has a
                time complexity of O(nm) which is significant as all the
                shape-based features have a complexity of O(n) and all the
                compression-based O(3n).
              </p>
              One disadvantage of the DTW algorithm is due to the matching of
              all points. As shown below, the outliers and noise in the
              time-series effect the resulting distance score. LCS does not
              suffer from this problem as the algorithm does not match all the
              points but looks for similar sub-sequences inside the compared
              time-series [10]. Secondly it has two inputs for adjusting both
              the distance threshold and the maximum number of allowed shift for
              alignment which are ε and δ respectively [11]. If the objects in
              the time-series database are close to each other, a small value of
              ε causes reduced extracted features which is infeasible for
              ranking. As the value of ε tends to infinity, the paths calculated
              by the algorithm become the same as that calculated by the
              lock-step measures.
